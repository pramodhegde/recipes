### 7. Final Steps

- Plate and serve immediately.
- Finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil for an extra touch.

## Suggestions

- **Peperoncino (Spicy Pepper)**: If you prefer a milder dish, you can skip the peperoncino entirely or use a less spicy variety of pepper.
- **Tomatoes**: Use very ripe, sweet cherry tomatoes for the best flavor. If they are not sweet enough, consider adding a small pinch of sugar while cooking the tomatoes.
- **Cheese**: You can substitute Parmigiano Reggiano with Pecorino Romano for a stronger, saltier flavor, or try a blend of both.
- **Pasta**: You can substitute spaghetti with other types of pasta such as linguine or fettuccine, depending on your preference.
- **Herb Variations**: Experiment with adding a few fresh oregano or thyme leaves along with basil to enhance the flavor of the sauce.
- **Vegan Option**: For a vegan version, omit the cheese or use a dairy-free alternative, such as vegan Parmesan.
