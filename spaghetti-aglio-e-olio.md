## Procedure

### 1. Cook the Pasta:
1. Bring a medium pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  
2. Add the spaghettoni and cook for a total of 16 minutes. Use slightly less water than usual to concentrate the starch in the pasta water.  

### 2. Make the Sauce:
1. While the pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet over low heat.  
2. Add parsley, peperoncino, and 1 clove of smashed garlic to the oil.  
3. Allow the aromatics to infuse the oil for a few minutes, then remove and discard the parsley, peperoncino, and garlic.  

### 3. Combine Pasta and Sauce:
1. A few minutes before the pasta finishes cooking, transfer it from the pot to the skillet using tongs (reserve the pasta water).  
2. Let the pasta finish cooking in the sauce over medium heat. Stir frequently.  

### 4. Add Fresh Aromatics:
1. Add freshly chopped chili, minced garlic, and parsley to the sauce.  
2. Season with salt to taste.  

### 5. Adjust Consistency:
1. Gradually add reserved pasta water to the skillet as needed to achieve a creamy consistency. Avoid making the sauce too runny.  

### 6. Plate and Serve:
1. Transfer the pasta to a plate or bowl.  
2. Garnish with fresh parsley, chili flakes, and a touch of finely grated or raw minced garlic.  
3. Serve immediately and enjoy!

## Notes

- **Substitutions:**
  - Substitute **cilantro** for parsley for a different flavor profile.  
  - Replace peperoncino with **red pepper flakes** or a small fresh red chili.  

- Cooking the pasta in less water ensures the pasta water is starchy, which helps create a creamy sauce.  
- Adjust the amount of chili and garlic to suit your spice preference.  
- For the best flavor, use high-quality olive oil.
