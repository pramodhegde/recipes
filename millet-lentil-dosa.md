### 2. Grind the Batter

#### In a **Vitamix** or similar high-power blender:
1. **Lentils**: Drain the lentils and fenugreek seeds. Add about **1/2 cup of lentils** to the blender with a small amount of water. Blend at low speed, gradually increasing to medium-high, until smooth and fluffy. Add water as needed (1–2 tablespoons at a time).

2. **Millets**: Drain the soaked millets. Add them to the blender and grind into a slightly coarse or smooth paste, depending on your preference. Add water gradually to maintain a thick but pourable consistency.

3. **Combine**: Transfer each batch to a large bowl and mix well using clean hands to aid fermentation.

### 3. Fermentation
- Add salt to the batter and mix thoroughly.
- Cover loosely and let it ferment in a warm place for **8–12 hours**, or until it rises and turns bubbly.

### 4. Make the Dosa
1. After fermentation, gently mix the batter. Adjust the consistency with water if necessary (it should be pourable, like pancake batter).
2. Heat a **non-stick** or **cast-iron griddle** on medium heat. Once hot, reduce the heat slightly.
3. Pour a ladleful of batter in the center and spread it in a circular motion to make a thin crepe.
4. Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges.
5. Cook until golden and crisp. Flip (optional) and cook briefly on the other side.
