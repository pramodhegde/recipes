### Other Ingredients:
- Olive Oil: **1/4 cup**
- Garlic Cloves: **8 large**, thinly sliced

## Equipment

---

## Instructions

### 1. Toast the Spices
- Heat a **cast iron skillet** over medium heat. 
- Add the cumin, coriander, and caraway seeds. Toast until fragrant, about **3–5 minutes**. Stir occasionally to avoid burning.

### 2. Sauté Aromatics
- Add **olive oil** to the skillet. Stir in the thinly sliced **garlic**, **onion**, and **salt**.
- Cook until the garlic begins to brown, about **2–3 minutes**. The salt will help draw out flavors and slow down the browning of the onions.

### 3. Add Tomato Paste and Peppers
- Stir in the **tomato paste** thoroughly. 
- Add the **Urfa Biber** (or **Aleppo Pepper**) and mix well. Cook for **1 minute**.

### 4. Add Vinegar
- Pour in the **red wine vinegar** and stir to combine.
- Cook for **2 more minutes**, or until the pungent vinegar smell cooks off.

### 5. Blend to Finish
- Transfer the mixture to a **food processor**. Blend until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed.
- Store the harissa in a glass container (avoid plastic) and refrigerate.

## Notes
- **Storage**: Harissa can be stored in the refrigerator for up to **2 weeks**. For longer storage, top it with a thin layer of olive oil to preserve freshness.
- **Substitution**: If Urfa Biber or Aleppo Pepper is unavailable, substitute with a mix of red chili flakes and sweet paprika (adjust to taste).
